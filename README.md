### data/
- This directory is intended for **read-only data** that is used as input for analyses.
- The struct is same as the one downloaded from Drive

### output/
- All new files, results, or figures generated by running the code should be saved here.
- Keeps your data and results organized and prevents accidental overwriting of source data.

**Note:** These folders are included in `.gitignore` and will not be tracked by version control, in order to keep large binary files and outputs out of the repository.
